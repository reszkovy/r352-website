## Industrial Buyer Personas

### 1. Design / Mechanical / Electrical Engineers

**Primary question:** "Does this meet my specs?"

**Behavior:** Task-driven, specification-obsessed, skeptical of marketing. Self-service by default — 60% of the buying process happens online before any salesperson contact. 72% spend at least half their research time online.

**Information sources (2025 TREW data):**
- Vendor websites: 73%
- Online trade publications: 73%
- Print technical publications: 45%
- Sales/application engineers: 37%
- Industry directories: 34%
- YouTube: 31%

**Most valued content:**
- Datasheets: 79%
- Technical articles: 61%
- CAD drawings: 37%
- Product demo videos: 35%
- Product reviews: 34%

**Most valued interactive tools:**
- Product selection / parametric search: 66%
- Product comparison tools: 59%
- Product configurators: 44%
- 2D/3D interactive graphics: 30%

**Search persistence:** 44% of European engineers filter through 5+ pages of results. Only 4% stop at page 1. They are thorough researchers.

**CAD specification-lock behavior:** 89% of designers only select components from manufacturers with CAD files online. 82% of businesses buy the physical part after CAD download. CAD models generate 2.5× greater leads than text-based information. Primary downloaders: engineers (53%), managers/directors (21%).

**AI skepticism:** Trust in AI-generated answers dropped to 4.4/10 (from 6.5 in 2024). 70% rarely or never use generative AI in purchasing decisions. Vendor websites and human expertise remain the primary trust anchors.

**Triggers for first sales contact:**
1. Technical complexity of solution (47%)
2. Pricing/inventory questions (40%)
3. Desire to validate online info (34%)
4. Interest in demo (26%)
5. Only 6% prefer no salesperson interaction at all

**What they hate:** Marketing fluff, gated content for basic specs, chat popups interrupting research, registration walls to see product data, stock photography.

### 2. Procurement Specialists

**Primary question:** "Can we source this reliably and affordably?"

**Behavior:** Compliance-focused, vendor management, relationship-driven. Evaluates suppliers on reliability, quality, financial stability, and delivery track record.

**Content needs:** Pricing structure, MOQs, lead times, payment terms, volume discounts, delivery track record, financial stability indicators.

**Trust signals:** ISO/AS/IATF certifications, client portfolio breadth, on-time delivery metrics, quality PPM rates.

**Conversion action:** Submit RFQ, request sample, initiate supplier qualification, negotiate contract.

**Buying committee reality (Forrester):**
- B2B purchases involve ~10 people (IT, operations, finance, end users)
- 72% of purchases involve high-complexity buying groups
- 86% of purchases stall during the process
- 81% of buyers express dissatisfaction with chosen providers
- 92% start evaluation with at least one vendor already in mind
- 41% have a single preferred vendor selected before evaluation begins

### 3. Operations / Materials Managers

**Primary question:** "Can we keep the line running without surprises?"

**Behavior:** Supply chain continuity focus. Concerned with inventory management, delivery reliability, and total cost of ownership rather than unit price.

**Content needs:** Availability status, delivery timelines, reorder capabilities, bulk pricing, supply chain redundancy evidence, inventory management integration.

**Conversion action:** Set up reorder agreements, establish vendor-managed inventory, configure automated replenishment.

---

### 4. Quality / Compliance Officers

**Primary question:** "Does this supplier meet our certification requirements?"

**Behavior:** Will disqualify manufacturers in seconds if certifications are not prominently visible. Gatekeepers for supplier qualification.

**Content needs:** ISO 9001 / AS9100 / IATF 16949 / ISO 13485 / ITAR / FDA / CE / UL certificates (downloadable PDFs), scope statements, facility audit information, material traceability documentation, test reports, material certificates.

**Conversion action:** Download certification documents, request audit information, initiate supplier qualification process.

---

### 5. Maintenance Technicians

**Primary question:** "What's the replacement part and can I get it fast?"

**Behavior:** Urgency-driven. Often accessing the site from the shop floor on mobile. Needs part number search, cross-reference tools, compatibility lookup, and technical support access.

**Content needs:** Part number search with cross-references, compatibility charts, replacement guides, maintenance documentation, emergency order paths, technical support contact.

**Conversion action:** Find and order replacement parts, access technical support, download maintenance guides.

## Dual-Persona Dynamic

The core UX challenge for industrial sites. Two fundamentally different users — engineers and procurement — need to navigate the same site within the same buying cycle, often within the same session.

| Dimension | Engineers | Procurement |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Goal** | Find spec → download CAD → specify in design | Evaluate vendor → request quote → negotiate |
| **Navigation** | Technical Resources, CAD/Specs, Product Search | Compliance/Quality, Pricing, Company Info |
| **Trust signal** | Complete specs, CAD availability, application data | Certifications, delivery metrics, financial stability |
| **Gating tolerance** | Zero — gating basic specs drives them to competitors | Moderate — will provide info for detailed quotes |
| **Content format** | Datasheets, CAD files, comparison tables | Certificates, pricing sheets, capability summaries |

**Implementation:** Global header with distinct pathways — "Technical Resources" (specs/CAD) and "Quality & Compliance" (certifications/audits). Both lead to the same products but through different lenses.

## Six Drivers of Exceptional Industrial Buyer Experience

From Accenture research across 1,600+ industrial buyer pain points:

1. **Reliability** — consistency and dependability of supply
2. **Quality** — product grade, durability, performance to spec
3. **Convenience** — ease of interaction, process navigation, self-service
4. **Transparency** — openness about specs, pricing, lead times, risks
5. **Responsiveness** — speed of inquiry handling, quote turnaround
6. **Proactiveness** — identifying needs before the customer asks

## "Coming from X" Warnings

### Coming from b2b-saas
Over-investing in benefit messaging and outcome language. Industrial buyers want specifications, not "outcomes." An engineer doesn't care that your fitting "improves operational efficiency" — they need the pressure rating, thread type, and material grade. Lead with specs, not benefits.

### Coming from ecommerce
Assuming simple add-to-cart flows. Industrial buying involves RFQs, custom configuration, compliance verification, drawing review, and multi-stakeholder approval. The checkout is a quote request, not a payment form.

### Coming from b2b-services
Over-emphasizing team and people. Industrial buyers trust certifications and equipment capabilities, not bios. A quality manager wants to see your ISO 9001 certificate and equipment list, not your team's headshots.
